# Replication materials for: "Marshes to mangroves: Resident attitudes and perceptions indicate perceived trade-offs in ecosystem services"

This repository contains R code for replicating the figures and analyses described in "Marshes to mangroves: Resident attitudes and perceptions indicate perceived trade-offs in ecosystem services" by Savannah H. Swinea, A. Randall Hughes, Michael J. Osland, Christine C. Shepard, Kalaina B. Thorne, Jahson B. Alemu I, RÃ©mi Bardou, and Steven B. Scyphers.

The complete dataset used in our analyses is available at the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative Information & Data Cooperative (GRIIDC): https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/data/H4.x954.000:0003; "A multi-region study of perceptions surrounding marsh and mangrove fisheries ecosystem services"; DOI: 10.7266/n8jvnrb3. 

# MangMarshFish Figs. 3 and 4

The R script entitled "MangMarshFishFigs3and4.R" can be used to replicate Figs. 3 and 4 from the publication, which show differences in perceptions of mangroves and marshes for delivering ecosystem services across different characteristics.  Fig. 3 shows differences across state of residence and study site, and Fig. 4 shows differences across frequency of recreational fishing and fishing location.

# MangMarshFish Fig. 5

The R script entitled "MangMarshFishFig5.R" can be used to replicate Fig. 5 from the publication, which represents and dot-and-whisker plot showing the results of an ordinal logistic regression investigating the interplay of multiple variables to predict perceptions of mangrove vs. marsh fisheries ecosystem service delivery.

# MangMarshFish Fig. S1

The R script entitled "MangMarshFishFigS1.R" can be used to replicate Fig. 1 from the Supplementary Material file, which displays a table of the demographic characteristics of the survey respondents.
